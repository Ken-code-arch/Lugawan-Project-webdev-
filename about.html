                <h2>Lugawan ni Lola</h2>
                <p>we don’t just serve food; we serve a story. Our journey began with Lola Maria, a woman of quiet strength and boundless love, who believed that the best way to show you cared was through a steaming, perfect bowl of lugaw.</p>
                <p>This isn’t just any rice porridge. It is the result of decades of careful practice—a recipe that was never written down but was etched in the rhythm of her patient stirring, the precise moment to add the slivers of ginger, and the careful balance of savory broth. For every scraped knee, every rainy day, and every joyous family gathering, Lola’s lugaw was there. It was a hug in a bowl, a whisper of reassurance, and the unmistakable taste of home.</p>
                <p>When we opened, our mission was simple: to share that enduring comfort with the world. Every dish, from our signature creamy Lugaw to our tangy Tokwa’t Baboy and crispy Bagnet, is a direct tribute to her kitchen. We honor her legacy by using the same care and the freshest ingredients, ensuring that every spoonful carries the warmth of her tradition.</p>
                <p>Welcome to our table. May you find the same comfort and family love In our food that we found In kitchen.</p>
